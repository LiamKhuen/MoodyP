## Why MOODYP?

Welcome! At the moody Foundation, we believe that sometimes coding can be a little too simple (easy)
sometimes. What happened to the days of unreliable punch cards and those little math machines that broke all the
f****** time?


### 1.1.1 WAIT SO WHAT IS MOODYP...?

moodyP is a very-angsty programming language (some people in industry call it a ‚ÄúVAP-language‚Äù). A nice way to
think of moodyP is to liken it to a nice broth-y soup:

                            ‚Äúlet me not be accounted for the taste of my soupiness,
                            
                                      but for the appearance of my broth
                                      
                                      and whether or not it will give me
                                      
                                               food poisoning‚Äù
                                               
                                                  -unknown
                                                  
Ah, yes, the old *soup* metaphor! moodyP essentially takes all the power and graft of other popular scripting
languages and very tightly packages their strength (strengths?) into a delicious bouillon cube of gooey goodness
that, much like a person, may or may not obey your every command. See? Cool!

More on this later.


### 1.1.2 THIS IS ANNOYING AND I WONT LIKE LEAR‚Äì

WOAH WOAH there, cowboy! Why, you don‚Äôt even know any of the syntax or other specially scrumptious aspects
of the moody Foundations‚Äô pride and joy of a language? Just settle on down and maybe have a smoke. Or not.
We at the moody Foundation, like, don‚Äôt really care what you do with your body, man. Just chill out and ride the
wave üòà.


### 1.1.3 THE MEAT OF THE SOUP

</p>

is a ‚Äúclass‚Äù. In the traditional world of computing, a class is an abstract concept (that miners have been digging at for nearly 170 years whilst subsequently trying to find a more suitable name for this darn idea) that defines a structure which represents a container of *things*. What kind of things? Well:
<p align='center'>
  things like var(s) which store data<br>
  things like <i>function(s)/procedure(s)</i> which do things with that data<br>
  things like <i>other stuff that we can talk about later since the two previous things are mostly used anyway</i>
</p>

Nah, just kiddin‚Äô. Classes actually can do quite a lot. For example‚Ä¶


### 1.1.4 FOR EXAMPLE

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve got a nice, small dog. Now, this dog never growls, it never bites, but sometimes it likes to walk and eat. 

<p align='center'>
  <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19754429/195483064-2875edd9-2490-4a3e-8c73-ebeb8f247daf.png' />
</p>

Since this dog sometimes likes to eat a bit, it will have a tiny little program in its avocado-sized brain that tells it to do so:

</p>

Nice! Now you‚Äôve got a normal dog. Yep, just a normal dog with a brain that can only tell it to do one thing.

Cool, so what we just created was something called a *subroutine*. Spell it with me now: S-U-‚Ä¶eh, sounds like you‚Äôve got it.


### 1.1.5 WAIT WHAT‚ÄôS THAT ONE THING BEFORE THE ‚ÄúEAT‚Äù PART

Looks like we‚Äôve got an observer over here! Yes, right before the **name** of a Function/Subroutine/Method (yes, these are all names used interchangeably and yes they all mean the same thing) you must describe what the hell it is first


### 1.1.6 COOL, I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT MOODYP!

Lol, no. Not so fast. You have to know about a bunch of other stuff too. Stuff like *Functions* which are similar to *Procedures* except that they are supposed to bring something back after doing stuff.

</p>

What‚Äôs that you say? *params? Return_Motion?* Alas, this is where the fun begins! You see, *moodyP* allows you, the soup-maker to create *Procedures* or *Functions* that take in certain inputs. Let‚Äôs say your dog eats only the finest rubbery boots (a prized item in the economy of *moodyP-landia*).
