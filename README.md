## Why MOODYP?

Welcome! At the moody Foundation, we believe that sometimes coding can be a little too simple (easy)
sometimes. What happened to the days of unreliable punch cards and those little math machines that broke all the
f****** time?


### 1.1.1 WAIT SO WHAT IS MOODYP...?

moodyP is a very-angsty programming language (some people in industry call it a ‚ÄúVAP-language‚Äù). A nice way to
think of moodyP is to liken it to a nice broth-y soup:

                            ‚Äúlet me not be accounted for the taste of my soupiness,
                            
                                      but for the appearance of my broth
                                      
                                      and whether or not it will give me
                                      
                                               food poisoning‚Äù
                                               
                                                  -unknown
                                                  
Ah, yes, the old /soup/ metaphor! moodyP essentially takes all the power and graft of other popular scripting
languages and very tightly packages their strength (strengths?) into a delicious bouillon cube of gooey goodness
that, much like a person, may or may not obey your every command. See? Cool!

More on this later.

### 1.1.2 THIS IS ANNOYING AND I WONT LIKE LEAR‚Äì

WOAH WOAH there, cowboy! Why, you don‚Äôt even know any of the syntax or other specially scrumptious aspects
of the moody Foundations‚Äô pride and joy of a language? Just settle on down and maybe have a smoke. Or not.
We at the moody Foundation, like, don‚Äôt really care what you do with your body, man. Just chill out and ride the
wave üòà.

### 1.1.3 THE MEAT OF THE SOUP
